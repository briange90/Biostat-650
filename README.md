# Biostat-650
This is 650 Final Project. In this project, we will use the “NHANES” data from the R package “NHANES”. Here is a brief introduction to NHANES: 
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a cross-sectional survey study designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. It began in the 1960s and since 1999 the survey moved to continuous data collection in two-year cycles. Approximately 5,000 individuals of all ages are interviewed in their homes every year and complete the health examination component of the survey. The sample for each two-year cycle is representative of the NHANES target population, which is the non-institutionalized civilian resident population of the United States. NHANES is used to determine the prevalence of major diseases and risk factors for diseases, as well as to assess nutritional status and its association with health promotion and disease prevention.
